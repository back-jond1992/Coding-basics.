# CSS Flexbox

Flexbox or flexboxes create page layouts for a dynamic UI (user interface). Arranges different elements in a predictable way for different screen sizes and browsers.

-CSS property 'display; flex;' on an element allows flex properties to be used to build a responsive page. 

-'flex-direction' allows you to allign elements into rows or columns.

-Sometimes not all the flex items within a flew container fill the container. 'justify-content' allows us to space out flex items.
    .'center' aligns the flex items in to the center.
    .'flew-start' aligns the flex items to the start of the container.
    .'flex-end' aligns the flex items to the end of the container.
    .'space-between' aligns the flex items to the center but with space      between the items.
    .'space-around' is the same as 'space-between' but with space all around the flex items so the first and last items do not touch the edges of the container.
    .'space-evenly' distributes space evenly between all the flex items.
