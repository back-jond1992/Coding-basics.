## Applied Accessability.

Applied accessability ensures web content can be understood by all, regardless of disabilities or resources. A great resource for projects going forward is the W3 Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). 

-'alt' attribute on image tags gives a text alternative to the image. Images with a caption still need an 'alt' attribute but an empty string ("") can be used.

-'h' tags should not be used just for their size qualities but should have semantic meaning and give order to HTML. 'h1' should only ever be used once.

-HTML tags give additional meaning. Tag names indicate the type of info they contain and give more semantic meaning to the content.
    .'main' tag is used to wrap the main content and is only used once per page. Shouldn't include items that are repeated across pages.
    .'article' is a element and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content. For example news articles or blog entries.
    .'div' groups any content.
    .'section' groups related content. 'section' tags can be used inside 'div' and 'article' tags.
    .'header' tags wrap introductory information or navigation links for it's parent tag. Wraps content that is repeated across the top of multiple pages.
    -'nav' tags wrap around navigation links on a page.
    -footer' tags wrap copyright information or links to related documents.
    -'audio' tags wrap sound or audio stream content. Audio content needs a text alternative either as text on the page or links to transcripts.
    -'figure' with 'figcaption' wrap visual representations (i.e pictures, diagrams etc.) and their captions.
    -'fieldset' tags wrap radio buttons and often use a 'legend' tag to provide a description of the grouping.
