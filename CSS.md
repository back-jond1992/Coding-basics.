## CSS

Text color is changed by changing the 'style' of elements. The property responsible for colour is the 'color' style property. For example <h1 style="color: pink;">Korean Cooking Recipes,/h1>.

(good practice to end inline style declarations with ';')

            or

Instead of styling the individual elements with inline CC, a style block can be created at the top of the code. To create a style block 'style' tags are used and inside the style block a CSS selector for the different elements can be made.

(curly braces must be used around each elements style rules.)

Classes are style which can be reused and added to HTML elements. In the CSS style element class names start with a period. The HTML element must have a class applied, for example <h1 class="red-text">Korean Cooking Recipes</h1>

Font size is controlled by 'font-size' CSS property.

Font is controlled by 'font-family' CSS property.
