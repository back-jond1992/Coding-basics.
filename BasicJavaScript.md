# JavaScript

JavaScript is a high level programming language that all modern web browsers support. Like HTML and CSS, it is a core technology.

-'//' allows you to leave comments at the end of your code. '//' tells JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. '/* comment here */' allows you to make a multi-line comment.

-JavaScript provides eight different data types: undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number and object.

-Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this using a label to point to data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types above ^^ can be stored in a variable. You can tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword 'var' in front of it. Variables can be made up of number. letter and $ or _, but no spaces or cannot start with a number.

-In JavaScript you can assign a value to a variable with '=' (the assignment operator). For Example:
var myName;
myName = 3;

-Once a value is assigned to a variable, you can assign the value of that variable to a different variable. For example:
var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;

-You can also initialize a variable to an initial value on the same line. For example:
var myName = 9
-When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of 'undefined'.

-In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive.

-'Number' is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data. '+' and '-' symbols are used for addition and subtraction. '*' to multiply. '/' for division. You can increment or add one to a variable with '++' and decrement or decrease a variable with '--'.

-Decimal numbers can also be used as variables too.

-'%' (the remainder operator) gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

-'+=' assigns a number to a variable and performs a mathematical operation at the same time.

- '-=' performs the same function but subtracts a number from a variable.

-'*=' multiplies and '/=' divides.

-A series of zeros or characters in quotation marks("") are called a 'string'. A string must start and end with " or '. In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	word boundary
\f	form feed

-In JavaScript you can concatenate (or link) strings together using '+'

-'+=' operator will concatenate a string a string onto the end of an existing string.

-You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.
