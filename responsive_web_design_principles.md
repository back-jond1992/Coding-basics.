# Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design is a way of design webpages and content so they respond effectively with different devices.

-'@media' has a media type and if the media type matches the type of device the content is displayed on, the styles are applied.

-Adding CSS properties 'mx-widtch: 100%;' and 'height: auto;' to an image make it responsive.

-Setting an images 'width' and 'height' values to half the values of the original file will make images appear properly on high-res displays.

-'vw' (viewport units) can be used instead of 'em' or 'px' to size text. 'vw' units are relative to the viewport dimensions of a device.
