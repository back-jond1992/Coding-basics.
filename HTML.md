## What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language used to create web pages. It is the standard language to describe the structure of a web pages and is comprised of different elements that tell the browser how to display content. For example 'this is a heading' 'this is a paragraph'.

# How to use HTML:

HTML uses tags. Most HTML elements have opening and closing tags.
    - <__> (opening tags)
    - </__> (closing tags)

'H' elements are used for headings and subheading. H1 being for headings and H2,3,4... used for subheadings.

'P' elements are used for paragraph text.

Commenting is a way of leaving notes in your code for other coders without affecting the final output.Comments start with <!-- and end with -->.

Other tags include: 'main', 'header', 'footer', 'nav' 'video' 'article' 'selection' and so on.

'img' elements add images to web pages, whilst 'src' attributes** point to specific images url. All 'img' tags must contain an 'alt' attribute.

(** attributes are tags inside tags.)

'a' elements (anchor elements) link your webpage to outside content. Anchor elements need a destination web address call an 'href' attribute.
Anchor elements can also be used for internal links. 'href' attribute is assigned to a '#' + the value of the 'id' attribute** you want to link to.

(** an id is an attribute that uniquely descries an element)
