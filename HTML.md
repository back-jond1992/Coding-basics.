# What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language used to create web pages. It is the standard language to describe the structure of a web pages and is comprised of different elements that tell the browser how to display content. For example 'this is a heading' 'this is a paragraph'.

## How to use HTML:

HTML uses tags. Most HTML elements have opening and closing tags.
    - <__> (opening tags)
    - </__> (closing tags)

'H' elements are used for headings and subheading. H1 being for headings and H2,3,4... used for subheadings.

'P' elements are used for paragraph text.

Commenting is a way of leaving notes in your code for other coders without affecting the final output.Comments start with <!-- and end with -->.

Other tags include: 'main', 'header', 'footer', 'nav' 'video' 'article' 'selection' and so on.

'img' elements add images to web pages, whilst 'src' attributes** point to specific images url. All 'img' tags must contain an 'alt' attribute.

(** attributes are tags inside tags.)

'a' elements (anchor elements) link your webpage to outside content. Anchor elements need a destination web address call an 'href' attribute.
Anchor elements can also be used for internal links. 'href' attribute is assigned to a '#' + the value of the 'id' attribute** you want to link to.

(** an id is an attribute that uniquely descries an element)

'ul' elements create unordered lists, followed by any number of 'li' elements.

'ol' elements create ordered lists, followed by any number of 'li' elements.

'input' elements are an easy way to get input from users. "<input type="text">". Input elements are self closing. You can place holder text in the input put element with 'placeholder' attribute.

'submit button'(s) send data from your form to the specified URL in the form's action attribute. 'action' attributes send data to a specified URL.

'required' attribute requires specific forms to be completed before the user can go further.

Radio buttons are used when only one answer can be selected out of multiple options. Radio buttons are a type of 'input' element and are nested inside 'label' elements.

Checkboxes are another 'input' element and are used when questions may have more than one answer and are nested in 'label' elements.

'div' element is a general purpose container for other elements.

At the top of all docs the browser must be told what version of HTML is being used. This is done with <!DOCTYPE ...> (case sensitive). The rest of the code is then wrapped in 'html' tags.

'head' and 'body' tags add more organisation in HTML documents. Any markup info goes inside the 'head' tag and markup content goes in the 'body' tag.
